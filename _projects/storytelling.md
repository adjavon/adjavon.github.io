A good story is the most effective way of communicating. 
For this reason, I attempt to weave storytelling into how I talk about my science, how I communcate difficult concepts. 
But I also enjoy storytelling for its own sake, which I do though world-building, role-playing games, and some short works of fiction which I will post here from time to time. 
They will be collected [here](/blog/tag/fiction/index.html).
