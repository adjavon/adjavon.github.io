My work currently revolves around using explainable AI methods to improve our ability to do science. Most recently, I have developped Quantitative Attributions with Counterfactuals {% cite adjavon2024quantitative %} or QuAC for short. This is a method that creates counterfactual explanations to describe the difference between classes, quantified by how well the features found affect the decisions of a pre-trained classifier.
