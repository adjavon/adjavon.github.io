In my professional life, I am as you saw on the [home page](index.markdown).

Aside from all of that, I like to fiddle around with things I have no business messing with.
When I am not complaining about code, you will find me crouching outside taking pictures of cool bugs.
I am currently an aspiring birder so I will get excited about every single Canada Goose that I see.

I also like to run long-ish distances, slowly but deliberately.
My best official 10k is 1h04.
My best official half is 2h27.
Marathon times pending.
If you are unhappy with those times, check out my [much cooler brother](https://triathlon.org/athletes/profile/163812/eloi_adjavon).
