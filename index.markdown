## Computers do some things better than us. This is fact. I'm just trying to take advantage of it.

I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher at the [Funke Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab) at [HHMI Janelia](https://www.janelia.org).
My research focuses on building interpretable computer vision tools to get the most out of (already extremely cool) microscopy.
Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh at the [Swain Lab](https://swainlab.bio.ed.ac.uk) where I worked on automating the segmentation of yeast cells and some of their organelles in order to study the dynamics of glucose starvation, and got my Master's from [ENS Lyon](http://www.ixxi.fr) working on information transfer in gene regulatory networks at the [LBMC](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LBMC/equipes/systems-biology-of-decision-making).

In my previous life studying computer systems security, I also got degrees from [Telecom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home)/[EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/home).
